#### Structure
Please keep the structure for assets, vector1.py and SVDExtension.py
- assets/, original files (corpus) and codes
- vector1.py, the IR engine source code
- SVDExtension.py, the SVD extension
- appendix.md(pdf), the homework deliverables and instructions

#### Notice
The IR engine is based on Python 3 and SVD extension is based on Numpy. I strongly recommend using a Python 3 virtual environment with Numpy installed.

The homework appendix files (.md and .pdf) in the directory contain lots of homework deliverables and instructions. Please read it for grading purpose (recommend using the pdf version).
